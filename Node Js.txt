So, before starting node project we will firstly install the package.json file 
to do so run the command npm init
and it will ask you some questions and then it will install the package
Before installing any project in node js it is necessary to use npm install (keyword)
There are two classes in which our packages are downloades "dependencies" and "devdependencies"
to save a package in dependencies we will write npm install name_of_package and run the command
to save a package in devdependencies we will write npm install --save-dev name_of_package and run the command


After all the installation we will start our project


1) Let's see what is import and export in node js:
=> first of all we will create two files index.js and index2.js now, what if we want to use index2 in index lets see...
This is also known as common js modules

2) Now we will see how to use node js modules
(https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v19.x/docs/api/)

3) What is Common JS modules and what are ECMA JS modules ??
=> As we have already seen what are common js modules now we will see ECMA JS modules
 we can't use mjs extension to save a file bcs it becomes an ecmascript after uing mjs extension
 and if we are saving a file with mjs extension we can't use require

 ECMA Script = import
 CJM = require

 4) Now we will build a server:
 To create a server  firstly we will import http module then, we will define a port and save it in const
 then we will create a server using http.createserver method in than we will define a function with two parameteres request and response after that we well make server listen on the port for that server.listen in that we will define a function and in function there will be a parameter called error if there is something wrong we will throw the error else successfull !
